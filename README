irclib -- Internet Relay Chat (IRC) protocol client library
-----------------------------------------------------------

This library is intended to encapsulate the IRC protocol at a quite
low level.  It provides an event-driven IRC client framework.  It has
a fairly thorough support for the basic IRC protocol and CTCP, but DCC
connection support is not yet implemented.

In order to understand how to make an IRC client, I'm afraid you more
or less must understand the IRC specifications.  They are available
here:

    http://www.irchelp.org/irchelp/rfc/

Unfortunately, this library isn't as well-documented as I would like
it to be.  There is some documentation in HTML format in the doc
subdirectory.  It is generated from the docstrings in irclib.py by the
pythondoc utility.  I think the best way to get started is to read and
understand the example program irccat, which is included in the
distribution.

The following files might be of interest:

  * irclib.py

    The library itself.  Read the code along with comments and
    docstrings to get a grip of what it does.  Use it at your own risk
    and read the source, Luke!  There is also an HTML version of the
    docstring documentation in the doc subdirectory.

  * irccat

    A simple example of how to use irclib.py.  irccat reads text from
    stdin and writes it to a specified user or channel on an IRC
    server.

  * servermap

    Another simple example.  servermap connects to an IRC server,
    finds out what other IRC servers there are in the net and prints
    a tree-like map of their interconnections.

Enjoy.

Since I seldom use IRC anymore, I will probably not work much on the
library.  If you want to help or continue developing the library,
please contact me.
