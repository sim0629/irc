IRC library for Python
----------------------

The following files might be of interest:

  * irclib.py

    The library itself.  Read the code along with comments and
    docstrings to get a grip of what it does.  Use it at your own risk
    and read the source, Luke!

  * irccat

    A simple example of how to use irclib.py.  irccat reads text from
    stdin and writes it to a specified user or channel on an IRC
    server.

  * servermap

    Another simple example.  servermap connects to an IRC server,
    finds out what other IRC servers there are in the net and prints
    a tree-like map of their interconnections.

Enjoy.
